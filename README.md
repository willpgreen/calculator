This is a simple web calculator implemented with JavaScript. This was an interesting project meant to gain more experience writing JavaScript functions and conditional statetments. It is a simple calculator that allows for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. My largest issue was allowing the user to string together multiple operations and accounting for order of operations. To accomplish this, I added variables to store the precedence of an operator and the previous operator that was entered.
